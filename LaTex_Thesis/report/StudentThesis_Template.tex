\begin{abstract}
 This thesis presents a reliable control method for a group of Wheeled Mobile Robots (WMRs) to cover a specific region. There are many useful applications of coverage control such as surveillance, exploration, and rescue operation. The motivation of the proposed control method is to ensure the performance of coverage control while being able to handle a given constraint set. There are three constraints considered in this work. The state constraint requires all agents to maintain in a specific range of a coverage region to ensure the communication ability. The input constraint is the bounded rotation velocity of a WMR due to the limits of its hardware components.
 The third constraint is the constant heading velocity, which makes the design of the controller challenging due to the underactuation. \\ \\
 Input constraints are ubiquitous and inevitable in practical. For this reason, this thesis is motivated to find a possible control law that is able to handle many constraints during the operation. In this project, we use the nonlinear anti-windup technique and the theorem of barrier Lyapunov function to deal with the above-mentioned constraints. To test the feasibility and evaluate the performance of the control strategy, we create a platform and simulate the coverage control. The proposed controller is proven and tested under different scenarios, such as the number of agents or regions with varying complexity. The proposed controller is distributed, feasible, and applicable. \\

\begin{center}
I would like to express my sincere thanks to my supervisors, Dr. Qingchen Liu and Mr. Zengjie Zhang, for their guidances through each stage of the process. Their enthusiasm has always been inspiring me to identify my research interests. \\
I am also grateful to Professor Sandra Hirche and all of the Department faculty lecturers for their knowledge and motivation that creates the love of Control Theory
in me.
